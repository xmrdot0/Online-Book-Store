            <p class="author">William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April
                1616) was an English playwright, poet, and actor,
                widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist.He
                is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard").His extant
                works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays,154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and
                a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major
                living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. They also continue
                to be studied and reinterpreted. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare">read
